Custom Operators
================

Tasrif also allows the user to build their own Operators if they need to do so.

The interface for an Operator is simple:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProcessingOperator
        def process(self, *data_frames):
            pass

By subclassing from :code:`ProcessingOperator`, a user can build their own
Operators. For example, suppose we needed an Operator that computes the number of
rows of each DataFrame passed to it:

.. code-block:: python

    from tasrif.processing_pipeline import ProcessingOperator

    class RowCountOperator(ProcessingOperator):
        def process(self, *data_frames):
            output = []

            for df in data_frames:
                output.append(len(df.index))

            return output

Let's test our new Operator:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> df1 = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'Date':   ['05-06-2021', '06-06-2021', '07-06-2021', '08-06-2021'],
    ...     'Steps':  [        4500,         None,         5690,         6780]
    ... })

    >>> df2 = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'Date':   ['12-07-2021', '13-07-2021', '14-07-2021', '15-07-2021'],
    ...     'Steps':  [        2100,         None,         None,         5400]
    ... })

    >>> RowCountOperator().process(df1, df2)
    [4, 4]

To ease the creation of custom Operators, we have created two convenience
classes: :code:`MapProcessingOperator` and :code:`ReduceProcessingOperator`. As
their names suggest, these are Operators that can be subclassed to create custom
Operators that have map or reduce processing behavior.

For example, let's use the :code:`MapProcessingOperator` to build the
:code:`RowCountOperator`:

.. code-block:: python

    from tasrif.processing_pipeline import MapProcessingOperator

    class RowCountOperator(MapProcessingOperator):
        def processing_function(self, df):
            return len(df.index)

As you can see, these convenience classes are a quick way of creating simple,
custom Operators.

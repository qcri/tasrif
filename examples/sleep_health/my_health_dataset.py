My Health Dataset details can be found online at ``https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18492837/wiki/593707``.
It contains a set of questions about many diseases.
For a disease X (X in Allergies, anxiety, apnea, asthma, atrial, hi_blood_pressure, etc.),

the following questions were made:
    - age_X            ('Age when participant was diagnosed with X')
    - current_X        ('Are you currently being treated for X?')
    - impactsleep_X    ('Does X impact your sleep?'')
    - sleepimpact_X    ('Does sleep impact your X?')

Question about the general health of the participant were also asked:
    - (compare_one_year) 'What is your general health rating compared to one year ago?'
    - (day_to_day) 'In past 7 days, how much did pain interfere with your day-to-day activities?'

    ... These questions had categorical answers.

The default pipeline:
    1. converts timestamp to datatime, sort the dataframe by time and removes all duplicates entries for the
       same participant id, retaining only the last one;
    2. transforms into NA some values (i.e. answer for a question being "Don't known") in all columns;
    3. Left the disease specific NA rows, but dropped NAs in the general health questions
    4. One hot encode the general health questions

Final dataset shape after default preprocessing pipeline is (1445, 160)
